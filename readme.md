# 3D Gaussian Splatting with Nvidia Warp

A simple, educational implementation of 3D Gaussian Splatting using NVIDIA's Warp framework for differentiable physics and rendering.

## Why This Implementation?

### âœ… CPU & GPU with Zero Hassle

Thanks to NVIDIA Warp, the same code runs seamlessly on both CPU and GPU â€” no need to deal with CUDA setup, driver issues, or device-specific kernels. Just change one line in the config.

### ðŸ§  Learn Modern Graphics the Easy Way

Explore core concepts in differentiable rendering and parallel graphics programming â€” no need for expensive GPUs or thousands of lines of boilerplate.

### ðŸ“¦ Minimalist & Educational

Forget overly complex libraries with thousands of lines. This repo is intentionally clean and easy to read â€” ideal for learning, experimenting, or building your own Gaussian Splatting variant.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/guoriyue/3dgs-warp-scratch.git
cd 3dgs-warp-scratch

# Install dependencies
pip install warp-lang numpy matplotlib imageio tqdm
```

### Download Example Data

```bash
# Download the Lego dataset
bash download_example_data.sh
```


### Rendering

```bash
# Render 3 Gaussian points â€“ a minimalist example
python render.py
```
You should see output similar to `example_render_.png`.

### Training

```bash
# Train on Lego dataset (CPU by default)
# For GPU training, change DEVICE in config.py to "cuda"
python train.py
```

forward.py and backward.py are adapted from [graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting), which provides a pure CUDA implementation.
Densification and pruning logic is adapted from [yzslab/gaussian-splatting-lightning](https://github.com/yzslab/gaussian-splatting-lightning), a PyTorch implementation.
